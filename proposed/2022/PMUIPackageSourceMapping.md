## Summary

Currently there is no support for package source mapping in the PMUI. I will add a feature that allows the user to choose a source to map a package to when they install it and a feature that shows all package source mappings in the preview. <!-- what is the preview window called after you hit install?? what is the window on the right of browse called where you can select a version??--> 
This feature is a portion of what was discussed in a previous spec. https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/dev/implemented/2021/PackageSourceMapping.md

## Motivation

Adding support for package source mapping in PMUI will allow user to make/view package source mappings with more ease.

## Explanation

### Functional Explanation

<!-- preview page--> Below the version drop down there will be a drop down where the user can select the sources they want to map a package to when installing it. The user will see what sources are mapped to the package when they click install <!-- preview changes page-->
